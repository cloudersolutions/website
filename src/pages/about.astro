        Clouder is building virtual cabling technology for commercial real estate to reduce cables,
        waste, spending, and emissions both in construction and throughout lifecycle renovations.
        Our solution also provides a possibility to cut operating carbon footprint and operating
        costs by providing data for truly efficient building automation.

      We are the first in the world to enable universal, system agnostic virtual cabling for all
      building technology systems. Doing this allows us to provide comprehensive data for truly
      smart building automation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of creating technology that enables more sustainable buildings, we do it so that it’s
      cheaper and makes construction and renovation projects significantly simpler and shorter.
