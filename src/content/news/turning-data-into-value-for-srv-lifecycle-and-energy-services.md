We are proud to announce that **SRV Energy & Lifecycle Services** has selected **Clouder** as their trusted building data integrator and provider.

By choosing Clouder, SRV reinforces its commitment to harnessing data for smarter property management, transparent ESG reporting, and efficient energy management. Together, we are driving forward more sustainable and innovative lifecycle services for the built environment.

> _“As we take responsibility for building operations and costs for 20 years, data is mission-critical. With Clouder, we’re able to collect data comprehensively and cost-efficiently to ensure optimal conditions while keeping operational costs low. ”_

## Turning 40,000 Data Points into Smarter Lifecycle Services

In our initial project, Clouder successfully gathered over 40,000 data points from a modern school building. This is noteworthy within an industry where obtaining high-quality, real-time data has traditionally been impossible, and the availability of fragmented data is often restricted to just a few thousand points. Furthermore, collecting even a limited amount of data has proven costly due to pricing models based on data points and different API users.

This data brings instant energy and cost savings for SRV Energy & Lifecycle Services. Many tasks that previously required on-site maintenance can now be handled remotely. For example, room controller setpoints can be automatically updated during unused hours, reducing unnecessary maintenance visits and energy consumption. Switching from scheduled to need-based maintenance also means filters and other components are replaced according to actual use, cutting costs and saving energy.

## Why the right data and integration platform matters

By choosing the right platform, SRV also ensures efficient reporting and full portfolio visibility. Energy managers spend less time in spreadsheets and more time creating value, while decision-makers gain a clear overview of all assets in one place.

## Jokirinne school project highlights:

*   **40,000+ data points** from a modern school building integrated.
    
*   **Remote management** replaces many on-site maintenance calls.
    
*   **Virtual meters** eliminate the need for investing in unnecessary new hardware, as the raw data points are already available (e.g. temperature and pump driving from heat exchangers).
    
*   **Read & write capability** means direct energy saving with e.g. automatic setpoint updates for room controllers during unused hours.
    

## Key benefits of Clouder’s data & integration platform in lifecycle and energy services:

*   **Efficient reporting**: less time in spreadsheets, more time for real work for energy and asset managers.
    
*   **Need-based maintenance** reduces costs and saves energy.
    
*   **Portfolio-wide visibility**: all assets in one place, enabling faster, smarter decisions.
