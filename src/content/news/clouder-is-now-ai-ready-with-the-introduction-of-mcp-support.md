We’re excited to announce that Clouder is now AI-ready, enabling seamless interaction with your building data through AI applications like **ChatGPT**, **Copilot**, or **Le Chat**. With this new capability, you can easily access and analyze your building data using natural language queries, making insights more accessible than ever. Watch the video below to see how it works.

## Introducing MCP support

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is how AI applications connect with external systems and data, and Clouder is bringing this to the real estate sector. With MCP support now available in Clouder, AI applications authorized by you can securely access your building data, allowing you to interact with it directly from platforms like **ChatGPT**, **Copilot**, and **Le Chat**.

This is perfect for quickly discovering anomalies in energy consumption, identifying optimization potentials, and getting actionable recommendations. Think of it like a tool for finding the needle in the heystack of building&nbsp;data.

For example, you can prompt things like:

- _Give the energy consumption report for our properties for the previous month._
- _Are our buildings currently meeting their energy efficiency targets?_
- _Are there overlapping heating and cooling periods in my building?_
- _What are the top 3 opportunities for optimizing energy usage across our portfolio?_

## Quality data is the foundation for effective AI solutions

For any AI application to deliver real value, it requires quality data. In real estate this is especially challenging, due to the poor quality and limited access to building data. It’s not enough to know that your building **is** consuming energy, you need to understand **why** it’s consuming that much.

This is where Clouder’s foundational data infrastructure excels. Our solution seamlessly integrates every system and device, performs on-site protocol conversions and data normalization, and makes your data available in real time. When paired with an AI application, you get a truly effective partnership for smarter building management.

Because Clouder’s cleaned data is rich in context and includes comprehensive timeseries information, AI applications can more easily detect changes in your building’s operational patterns, such as:

- Detecting damaged valves that fail to raise the temperature to the desired level.
- Uncovering conflicts between systems that don’t naturally communicate, such as HVAC and KNX.

Both scenarios are difficult to identify manually, but with AI, spotting these issues becomes much easier.

## What’s next 

MCP support in Clouder is just getting started. We’re actively working to expand the range of available tools and enhance our correlation capabilities, enabling you to gain deeper insights and improve building&nbsp;performance.

Clouder customers can already try out these features today by adding Clouder as an MCP Connector to their AI application. If you’d like to learn more or need help getting started, [drop us a line](/contact).
