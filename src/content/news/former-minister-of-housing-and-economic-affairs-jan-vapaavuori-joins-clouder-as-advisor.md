Why Jan Vapaavuori? 

Jan’s career uniquely bridges **city leadership, national policy, and European investment**, making him an ideal advisor for Clouder’s ambition to reshape real estate sustainability:

*   Minister of Housing (2007–2011) and Minister of Economic Affairs (2012–2015) in Finland, where he led transformative initiatives like the Meyer Turku shipyard transaction (revitalizing Finland’s maritime industry) and a housing program that significantly reduced long-term homelessness.
    
*   Vice President of the European Investment Bank (2015–2017), overseeing funding, treasury, and urban development.
    
*   Mayor of Helsinki (2017–2021), driving sustainable urban growth.
    
*   Currently, he serves as Chair of Finnvera (Finland’s export credit agency), and Senior Counsel at Geradin Partners.
    

Jan’s deep experience in **policy, investment, and urban development** aligns perfectly with Clouder’s goal: **to create smarter, greener buildings and portfolios through AI-driven operations**.

A shared vision for impact 

“Jan’s insights are invaluable for a high-growth company like Clouder,” says **Tomi Grönlund, Co-founder & CEO**. “His expertise will help us navigate the complexities of the real estate industry and accelerate our mission to lead the transition to digitalizing buildings.”

For Jan, Clouder’s ambition resonates with his own commitment to global impact:

> _Finland may be a small country, but it has big ambitions and Clouder is a prime example of that. Their mission to redefine how buildings operate, perform, and contribute to a net-zero future is not just innovation; it’s the blueprint for solving global challenges in energy efficiency, asset optimization, and smart infrastructure._
