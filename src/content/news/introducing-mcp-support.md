We’re excited to announce that Clouder is now AI-ready, enabling seamless interaction with your building data through AI applications like **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, or **Le Chat**. With this new capability, you can easily access and analyze your building data using natural language queries, making insights more accessible than ever. Watch the video below to see how it works.

## Introducing MCP support

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is transforming how AI applications connect with external systems and data—and Clouder is bringing this innovation to the real estate sector. With MCP support now available in Clouder, authorized AI applications can securely access your building data, allowing you to interact with it directly from platforms like **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Le Chat**.

This is great for quickly discovering anomalies in energy consumption, identifying optimization potentials, and getting actionable recommendations. Think of it like a tool for finding the needle in the heystack of building data.

For example, you can prompt questions like:

<!-- Todo paremmat kyssärit, mätsää videon kanssa -->

- _"What are the top 3 energy optimization potentials in my building?"_
- _"Are ther overlapping heating and cooling periods in my building?"_
- _"How has the energy consumption trend changed over the past year?"_


## Why current AI solutions aren’t delivering

For any AI application to deliver real value, it needs complete, accurate, and clean building data. While this may sound straightforward, achieving it is often anything but simple. It’s not enough to know that your building **is** consuming energy, you need to understand **why** it’s consuming that much.

This is where Clouder excels. Our solution seamlessly integrates every system and device, performs on-site protocol conversions and data normalization, and makes your data available in real time. When paired with an AI application, you gain powerful insights and a truly effective partnership for smarter building management.

Because Clouder’s cleaned data is rich in context and includes comprehensive timeseries information, AI applications can more easily detect changes in your building’s operational patterns. For example, AI can help with:

- Detecting damaged valves that fail to raise the temperature to the desired level
- Uncovering conflicts between systems that don’t naturally communicate, such as HVAC and KNX.

Both cases are difficult to identify manually, but with AI, spotting these issues becomes much easier.

## What’s next 

MCP support in Clouder is just getting started. We’re actively working to expand the range of available tools and enhance our correlation capabilities, enabling you to gain deeper insights and make more informed decisions about energy management – directly from your preferred AI application.

Clouder customers can already try out these features today in AI agent chats by adding Clouder as an MCP Connector. If you’d like to learn more or need assistance getting started, feel free to reach out.
