We're introducing MCP support to Clouder API, allowing you to interact with your building data using AI applications like Le Chat, Claude, or ChatGPT. This new capability makes it easier than ever to access and analyze building data by using natural language queries. See it in action in the video below.

## Key features

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol designed to connect AI applications with external systems. Through MCP, auhtorized AI models can securely access Clouder API in order to interact directly with your building data.

This is great for quickly discovering anomalies in energy consumption, identifying optimization potentials, and getting actionable recommendations. Think of it like a tool for finding the needle in the heystack of building data.

For example, you can prompt questions like:

- _"What are the top 3 energy optimization potentials in my building?"_
- _"Are ther overlapping heating and cooling periods in my building?"_
- _"How has the energy consumption trend changed over the past year?"_

MCP support in Clouder is just getting started. We’re working on expanding the range of supported queries and enhancing our correlation capabilities, so that you’ll be able to gain even deeper insights and make more informed decisions about energy management – right from your favorite AI application of choice.


## How to get stated

Connecting Clouder’s MCP server to your AI platform is quite straightforward. The process varies by platform, but typically involves adding a new MCP connector. If you’ve signed in to your AI platform using the same method as Clouder, linking your accounts should be seamless.
